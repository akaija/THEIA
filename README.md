#THEIA

THEIA was the Titan goddess of sight and the shining ether of the bright, blue    
sky. Her name is derived from the Greek words *thea* "sight" and *theiazo*    
"prophesy". We hope that this matplotlib visualization tutorial aids you in   
your quantitative search for an understanding of *res naturalis* "natural    
law".
